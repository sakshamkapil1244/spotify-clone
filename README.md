Asset-driven cards and sections render a realistic streaming interface without a backend.
Structure is framework-agnostic, enabling easy migration to React, Vue, or a full-stack stack if required.
Technology stack
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for layout, theming, and responsiveness
JavaScript for basic interactions
Project goals
Provide a clean, extensible front-end foundation for a music streaming UI.

Future enhancements
Integrate a real music API for search, playback metadata, and user libraries.
